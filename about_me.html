        Hi, my name is Swati and I come from the city of Kapurthala. I completed my schooling from KVK Cantt and went on to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Science from HMV College Jalandhar. I then pursued a Masters degree from DAV University Jalandhar, and later completed my B.Ed from Kapurthala. <br>

After working as a teacher for 2 years, I decided to explore the field of software development and started a Full Stack Development bootcamp with AccioJob. During the course, I learned various programming concepts such as Java, intermediate DSA, OOPs, and design principles. I also gained practical experience by building projects using Java AWT, Java Swing, Java Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and JPA Hibernate. <br>

Apart from my professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in painting and enjoy playing badminton in my free time. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career and look forward to contributing to the field of software development.
